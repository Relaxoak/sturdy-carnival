The gameplay follows that of the card game, but includes a story mode that follows the origin story of five of the game's Planeswalkers. This is the first game in Stainless' series to feature free-form deck construction and the ability to build a card library using both in-game rewards and microtransactions to purchase new cards and boosters. The game includes single player modes and online battles with other players.</p><p>Wizards of the Coast pulled the game from sale and discontinued in-game storefront features in November 2019, through the game remains playable.</p><h2><span>Gameplay</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><p>The core game follows the standard rules of the collectible card game (except that you can only use 1 mythic, 2 rares, and 3 uncommons of any card) <i>Magic: The Gathering</i>, first released in 1993; each player has a deck of cards consisting of lands and spells. Lands are used to generate 'mana', the resource needed to cast spells. Mana comes in five colors, and cards may require colored or generic (mana of any color) to be cast. Spells come in many varieties, from sorceries and instants which have one-time effects, to summoned creatures which can attack and defend from opponents. Players alternate turns playing land cards, casting spells, and attacking opponents until all but one player's life total is reduced to 0.</p><img src='https://media.thestar.com.my/Prod/49ED388D-50B8-4386-99C4-1706DC864B72' alt='Duels' title='Duels'><p><i>Magic Duels: Origins</i> frames the core game around a single-player story mode, and an online battle mode. In story mode, the player steps through the origin story of five different Planeswalkers, Chandra Nalaar, Jace Beleren, Gideon Jura, Nissa Revane, and Liliana Vess.<sup>[2]</sup> Each Planeswalker has five or more duels with computer-controlled opponents. The player uses a deck based on the selected Planeswalker, and as they complete each of the duels, enhance that deck though the pre-selected addition of new cards. These decks, with whatever enhancements they have unlocked, are also available to the player in battle mode.</p><p>Battle mode lets players use pre-made decks or to construct decks from their collection of cards, and play against either computer opponents or online opponents; match types include one-on-one matches with players tracked on leaderboards, and Two-headed Giant (two-vs-two). Computer opponents in these modes can be selected from three difficulty levels, with higher difficulties gaining more rewards for the player. The computer opponents' decks will be procedurally generated, effectively randomizing the type of decks the player will face.<sup>[2]</sup> Playing through either mode can earn the players in-game money to be used to buy new booster packs or specific cards to expand their card library; there are also various daily objectives for players to complete for in-game money, and all players are rewarded for helping to complete various community goals. Players can also purchase in-game money with microtransactions, but is not required to gain access to all cards and features.<sup>[3]</sup></p><h2><span>Card sets</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><p>The game was released primarily around the <i>Magic Origins</i> set of cards, the most recent release of the physical cards at the time of the game's introduction, with plans to expand the game to include upcoming card sets.<sup>[4]</sup> The Battle of Zendikar, Oath of the Gatewatch, Shadows Over Innistrad, Eldritch Moon, Kaladesh, Aether Revolt, and Amonkhet sets are currently available on Magic Duels.<sup>[5]</sup></p><h2><span>Development</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><img src='https://timelinecms-library.newgameplus.tv/?width=1600&image=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rocketchainsaw.com.au%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F07%2F1-Enchantments-EN.png' alt='Magic Duels Origins Ps4 Release' title='Magic Duels Origins Ps4 Release'><p><i>Magic Duels: Origins</i> was developed by Stainless Games who have been creating computer versions of the <i>Magic</i> series since 2009's <i>Magic: The Gathering – Duels of the Planeswalkers</i> and new titles on an annual basis. These prior games did not include the ability to construct decks or build card libraries, instead primarily using designed decks that could be customized with predetermined additional cards earned through winning matches. Later games included sealed deck play where players would be given a number of booster packs and could build a deck from those cards, but those cards would only be available for that deck. With <i>Magic Duel: Origins</i>, the series now includes the ability for players to collect and buy cards and construct decks as they would normally in the physical version of <i>Magic</i>. Wizards of the Coast's Dan Barrett stated that with this change, the computer version now is much closer to the physical version, and hopes that this will help enable more players to experience <i>Magic</i> and transition to the physical game.<sup>[2]</sup></p><p>On November 26, 2019, Wizards of the Coast announced that it was ending support for <i>Magic Duels</i>, removing the game from digital storefront and disabling in-game purchases, though the game will remain playable with both single-player modes and multiplayer matchmaking.<sup>[6]</sup></p><h2><span>Reviews</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><p>It has a score of 78% on Metacritic.<sup>[7]</sup></p><p>Caitlin Cooke, from Destructoid mentioned, '<i>Those new to Magic will find it easy to dive in and learn the intricacies of deck-building, while more experienced players should finally have the customization and card variety they’ve been asking for.</i>'<sup>[8]</sup>Game Informer gave it a score of 8.75 out of 10.<sup>[3]</sup></p><h2><span>References</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><h2>Magic Duels Origins Ps4 Release Games</h2><ol><li><span><b>^</b></span><span><cite>Minotti, Mike (28 July 2015).

Some have attempted to translate the card game to electronic play nearly exactly; others have taken more liberties and drawn more from the setting than the actual rules of the card game. Benefits of successful video game versions of the card game include convenience, practice, and challenge. However, artificial intelligence for a game such as <i>Magic</i> is an extremely hard problem, and such software usually must be continuously updated to stay current with recently released card sets. Video game versions often expand on artwork, and may include unique cards that rely on randomness, effects which would be difficult or annoying to duplicate in real life.</p><h2><span><i>Magic: The Gathering</i></span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><p>Named after the game itself, <i><b>Magic: The Gathering</b></i> was published by MicroProse in February 1997. The game takes place in the plane of Shandalar, where the player must travel the land and fight random enemies to gain cards, and defeat five wizards representing the five colors. The player must prevent one color from gaining too much power, and defeat the planeswalker Arzakon, who has a deck of all five colors. Adventure game and role-playing game elements are present, including inventory, gold, towns, dungeons, random battles, and character progression in the form of new abilities and a higher life point total. Two expansion packs were published, <i>Spells of the Ancients</i> and <i>Duels of the Planeswalkers</i>.</p><p>The game is notable as being the last game the esteemed game designer Sid Meier (<i>Civilization</i>, <i>Railroad Tycoon</i>) worked on while employed by MicroProse, though his involvement was short. Meier left before development was complete to found Firaxis Games.<sup>[<i><span>citation needed</span></i>]</sup></p><h2><span>Magic: The Gathering: BattleMage</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><p><i><b>Magic: The Gathering: BattleMage</b></i> is a real time strategy game published in January 1997 by Acclaim for both PCs and PlayStation. It was also in development for the Sega Saturn, but this version was cancelled in mid-1997.<sup>[1]</sup> In addition to the real time strategy game, <i>BattleMage</i> has a head-to-head mode.<sup>[2]</sup> It is set on the continent of Corondor, where a planeswalker named Ravidel forces the most powerful mages to fight each other, so that he can eventually destroy them and conquer the land. The game had a poor critical reception due to its unfair AI, unfriendly interface, and unbalanced gameplay.<sup>[<i><span>citation needed</span></i>]</sup></p><p>Spectrum Holobyte filed a lawsuit after Acclaim published the PC version in January 1997, claiming Acclaim had violated an agreement the two companies made in November 1996 which established a release schedule for the game, with the two companies publishing it for different platforms.<sup>[3]</sup> In October of 2018, the game's rights were acquired by Canadian production company Liquid Media Group along with other titles originally owned by Acclaim Entertainment.<sup>[4]</sup></p><p>Critical response to the game were mostly negative, with reviewers criticizing that it bears no resemblance to the card game in either structure or spirit,<sup>[5]</sup><sup>[6]</sup> and is unfairly difficult due to the AI opponent's ability to act instantly while human players are slowed by the complicated interface.<sup>[5]</sup><sup>[6]</sup><i>Electronic Gaming Monthly</i><span>'</span>s reviewers found the game confusing and graphically unimpressive, and said it would appeal to fans of the card game only.<sup>[7]</sup></p><h2><span>Magic: The Gathering: Armageddon</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><p><i><b>Magic: The Gathering: Armageddon</b></i> is an extremely rare arcade game published by Acclaim in 1997, somewhat similar to <i>BattleMage</i>. It is possible that as few as four machines were made. Acclaim's Mountain View, California-based coin-op division went out of business shortly after creating the game, so it never went into full production.<sup>[8]</sup><i>GamePro</i> reported that <i>Armageddon</i> was shown to their editors behind the scenes at the 1997 ASI show in Las Vegas, but did not appear on the show floor.<sup>[9]</sup> The arcade board used 3dfx components and included 600 MB of RAM.<sup>[10]</sup></p><p>Gameplay is a cross between real time combat and strategy, with characters representing one of the five colors. White had healing and soldiers; Blue countermagic and water creatures; Black death and undead creatures; Red fire and mountain creatures; and Green elves and forest magic. The game was controlled with a trackball, and supported up to two players.<sup>[11]</sup> Players could summon creatures to the arena as well as attack the opposing wizard directly.<sup>[12]</sup></p><h2><span>Magic: The Gathering (Sega)</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><p><i><b>Magic: The Gathering</b></i> is a Dreamcast game published and released by Sega in June 2001, though in Japan only.

It includes cards from <i>6th edition</i>, <i>Alliances</i>, and <i>Tempest</i>.

Updates become available as new sets are printed. Games are held in chatroom-style sessions, and virtual cards can be won or purchased with real money. <i>Magic Online</i> offers a variety of both casual games in which players can use cards they own for fun, and competitive online tournaments in which players use purchased/traded tickets and booster packs to enter into events, both Limited (decks built with cards opened from boosters) and Constructed (decks built from a player's collection).</p><h2><span>Magic: The Gathering – Battlegrounds</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><p><i><b>Magic: The Gathering – Battlegrounds</b></i> is an Atari game released in 2003 for both the PC and Xbox platforms.
